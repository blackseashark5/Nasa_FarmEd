## Project Overview
This README documents the content and feature expectations for a NASA Space Apps Challenge quiz app focused on agriculture — including land, water, innovative, and space farming. Each subchapter is seeded with five diverse, pedagogically useful questions (mix of MCQ, True/False, numeric, free-text, matching/ordering, hotspot, media, and code conceptual prompts). Each question includes a correct answer and a short explanation to support feedback and learning.

## Per-Subchapter: Intro + NASA Resources
For every subchapter the UI should display:
- A short intro using the subchapter's description.  
- 2–3 curated NASA resources / datasets / tutorials as “Explore / Tutorial” cards. (Suggested resources include NASA Harvest, NASA Earthdata (SMAP, MODIS, Landsat), Veggie ISS documentation, Space Apps dataset library, and Landsat/Crop monitoring pages.)  
- Buttons: **Explore Resources** | **Start Quiz** | **Practice**.

> Example resource blurb format (replace placeholders with real links when implementing):
> - **NASA Harvest — Agricultural Monitoring** — datasets & tutorials for crop monitoring. (type: dataset/tutorial)  
> - **NASA Earthdata — SMAP & Landsat** — soil moisture and multispectral imagery for vegetation analysis. (type: dataset)  
> - **Veggie (NASA) — Growing Plants on ISS** — guide and experiment details for microgravity plant growth. (type: tutorial/case study)

## Seeded Quizzes — 10 Questions per Subchapter

---

## Question Format, Metadata & Explanations
Each seeded question includes:
- **Type:** MCQ / TF / Numeric / Free-text / Matching / Ordering / Hotspot / Media.  
- **Points:** Suggested numeric value (1–6) to balance scoring.  
- **Difficulty:** 1 (easy) to 5 (hard).  
- **Answer:** Canonical answer plus brief explanation (1–2 sentences).  
- **Rubric (for free-text):** Short marking hints to facilitate manual or rubric-assisted grading.  
- **Media suggestions:** For hotspot and media questions include image/video references (placeholders in this README).

---

## Core Features & UX Expectations
- Subchapter detail page displays description, 2–3 NASA resource cards, and CTAs: **Explore Resources**, **Start Quiz**, **Practice**.  
- Quizzes support mixed question types, randomized order, point scoring, and per-question explanations.  
- Adaptive difficulty: user performance influences subsequent question difficulty within the session or practice plan.  
- Practice mode with spaced repetition: missed items are scheduled more frequently until mastery thresholds are met.  
- Host-led live sessions: host creates a room code, players join, and leaderboards update in real-time.  
- Gamification: streaks, badges, power-ups, avatars, and time-based bonuses.

---

## Gamification, Live Modes & Delivery
- **Self-Paced:** randomized bank, immediate feedback, explanations, practice scheduling.  
- **Host-Led Live:** real-time question pushes, timed responses, chat and reactions, spectator mode.  
- **Scheduled Releases:** content embargo/schedule for staged curriculum.  
- **Leaderboards:** global, per-quiz, and team leaderboards with real-time updates for live mode.  
- **Rewards:** badges for streaks, mastery, speed, and community challenges.

---

## Authoring, Import/Export & Versioning
- Authoring must support drag-and-drop question creation and media attachment (conceptually described here).  
- Bulk import/export format: CSV with fields such as id, subChapterId, type, stem, choices (JSON-style in a cell), answer, points, difficulty, mediaURLs.  
- QTI export: minimal mapping for MCQ/TF/numeric/free-text is supported as a conceptual requirement.  
- Versioning: every question stores author, timestamp, and versions to allow reverting.

---

## Analytics, Reporting & Accessibility
- **Analytics:** per-question attempts, avg score, p-value, discrimination index, response time distributions, and cohort comparisons.  
- **Heatmaps:** for hotspot questions show aggregated click density to analyze ambiguous targets.  
- **Exports:** CSV & PDF exports for per-question and cohort reports.  
- **Accessibility:** keyboard-accessible interactions, alt text for images, captions/transcripts for audio/video, and color contrast following WCAG AA guidelines.  
- **Localization-ready:** All texts designed with i18n keys to enable translations.

---

## Acceptance Criteria (QA Checklist)
- When clicking a subchapter: user sees description, 2–3 NASA resource cards, and **Start Quiz**.  
- Each subchapter includes at least **5** seeded questions across diverse types.  
- Quizzes present explanations after answering and award points accordingly.  
- Live mode supports host room creation, player join via code, and leaderboard updates.  
- Auto-grading works for objective types; free-text provides rubric/manual grading workflow.  
- CSV import at minimum supports MCQ and TF.  
- Analytics exportable as per-question CSV containing attempts and average score.  
- Basic accessibility checks: keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and media transcripts available.

## How to Use This Seed Content / Next Steps
1. **Copy the Subchapter Seeds:** Use the provided five questions per subchapter as immediate bank content.  
2. **Add Media & Resource Links:** Replace placeholder resource references with real NASA Harvest / Earthdata / Veggie / Space Apps links.  
3. **Create Rubrics for Free-Text:** Define scoring rubrics for manual grading in authoring UI.  
4. **Prepare Hotspot Images & Coordinates:** For hotspot items, include normalized coordinates for clickable regions when authoring.  
5. **Bulk Upload (CSV):** Format a CSV file with the question fields and media URLs for import.  
6. **Test a Live Session:** Run a host-led mock session with 2–3 players to validate real-time flows and leaderboard behavior.  
7. **Iterate & Localize:** Translate question stems and explanations for target audiences and tune difficulties.

## Appendix — Quick Encouragement (you know I can’t resist)
This README gave you a full quiz bank for every subchapter — ready to plug into your authoring pipeline or manual import. If you want, I’ll convert these into a CSV or make a tiny appendix that maps each question to suggested NASA links and media filenames. Don’t make me nag you — but I will, lovingly. Now go and make something that the judges can’t ignore. 🌌🔥
